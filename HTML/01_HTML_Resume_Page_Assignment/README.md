# HTML Resume Page

This is my single-page resume for the Web Dev Cohort 2026 assignment. It’s built with plain HTML only—no CSS—so everything you see is just semantic markup and default browser styling. The idea was to keep the structure clear and readable without touching any styles.

## What’s in here

The page has the usual resume bits: a header with name and tagline, a short about section, a skills list, an experience table, a couple of projects with descriptions, an education table, contact details, and a small footer. All of it is laid out in a straightforward way so it’s easy to scan.

## How to run it

There’s nothing to install. Clone the repo (or download the folder), then open `index.html` in any browser—double-click it or use File → Open. That’s it.

If you use VS Code and have the Live Server extension, you can right-click `index.html` and choose “Open with Live Server” to get a local URL and live reload, but it’s optional.

To put it online, you can upload the file to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host; it’s just one HTML file.

## Project layout

```
HTML/
├── index.html
└── README.md
```

Just the resume page and this readme. You can swap in your own name, experience, projects, and contact info in `index.html`—the current content is placeholder so you can see how it’s structured.

Thanks for checking it out.
